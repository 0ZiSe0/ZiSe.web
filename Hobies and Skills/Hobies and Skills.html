                            I have been drawing since 
                            I knew how to pick up a pencil.
                            I started taking drawing classes when i was 10.
                            I stopped occationaly, but i would always pick up the pencil
                            and start doing some lines.

                            starting this journey and make it my dream job.

                                My first ever painting was an oil painting. A landscape full of trees.
                                It wasn't that good but it was a start. I started doing paint at the same time 
                                I applied at my drawing classes. It was mostly acrylic painting.    
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I tried different types of paint such as water based paint and also sand painting.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Thanks to this skill I will be able to apply it to my crafts and add some unique touches to it.

                            I am reletively new to this hobby. I started just a year ago and haven't honed this skill yet.
                            It is a very entertaining skill to play with. I am working on towards doing digital sculpting
                            using Blender and other softwares.

                            I had my first guitar at an age of 8. It was a small guitar, and my first teacher was my uncle.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            i stopped playing guitar for a while and then came back and teached myself to be better at playing.
                            Since then I love playing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I hope that by learning and becoming better, i will be able to make music for my videos.
